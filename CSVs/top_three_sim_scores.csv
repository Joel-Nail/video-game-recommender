1 Moment of Time, Is a hidden object type game where you take on the role of a helpful soul out to help silentville with thier troubles, It has all the standard features of a find game, pointer, hints, Some humor, and lots of achievements, Let me rephrase that, Quite a lot of achievements for a point and click puzzle game. A couple of things to note however, This game is a little different then most puzzle games - there are more puzzle with-in puzzles then most hidden object games - Where other games have one or inside puzzle, puzzles, this game has 11+ So if you like puzzles, You'll fit right in here.

There are a couple of things to note however about this game - Not nessarily bad, just differnent, First Most of the item examples in it are from the other side of the pond, UK, and North American players might have troubles finding certain items. The second minor issue is that there are a few items that predate the player. World war 2 era can opener's for example. If i hadn't gone camping with scout's i would never had known it was a can opener.  Granted it is a minor thing if your playing on casual, however if your trying on expert (hard) mode, and are tying to finish the game with out hints, you may have to refer to the internet to look things up, Or at least asking mom and dad.

I'd like to mention at this point, as with all hidden object games, expect to clock up some miles going here and there to solve things

Some Cons 

 It's short. 3-4 hours on Expert. Probably shorter if your playing causal.  Granted the many, many achievments in the game will keep you going back if your dedicated to finishing them all.

There is an issue with trying to enter the store room with out fixing the door to exit the train-station. If you enter the store room, the game will crash on and off, just for that room. Oh btw, you don't need a screwdriver for the door to the trainstation, i went looking because how labour intensive this game is. Just a heads up.

There are minor issues with finding items just out of reach at the edges of the screen. Being able to minimize the search bar and/or drag or move the screen would have helped with this.

Sound and graphics are what you would expect with this type of title, 

Would i reccoment this product? yes. It's a good example of hidden object games (i own many) I only wish it was a little longer. I didn't research the producer, so i don't know if this is thier first, or one of many hidden object games. regardless, It's only a couple of bucks in the steam store, (at least when i saw it) which is peanuts for an afternoon's entertainment.
